# GameOff2020
A repository for our 2020 Github Game Off entry, Launch Party!

## About
Launch Party is a multiplayer ship-programming game played via Twitch stream.
Write some code, send it as a comment, and watch your ship take off! Everyone
is racing to be the first to land on the moon.

Since it's a party game, **it's recommended you play this game with three or
more people.** It's playable in any browser that supports Twitch, as well as on
mobile with the Twitch app.

This game was made for the 2020 Github Game Off with the theme "Moonshot." All
game programming, art, music, and sound design were completed within the one-month jam.

​The entire game's source code is available in
[our Github repository](https://github.com/jeremycryan/GameOff2020).​ Feel free
to use and distribute it in any way permitted by the MIT license.

## How to play
If the game is already being hosted in a Twitch stream, you can just jump right
in! Follow the instructions on screen and use the comments to play.

If you're looking to host your own stream, you can do one of the following:

### Using Python 3.8.3

If you have a Python 3.8.3 environment, you can use the following command to
install PyGame via pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

If you have something other than pip set up to manage your libraries, then...
you probably don't need directions for it.

To run the game, navigate to the `src` directory and run `game.py`.

### Using the Windows executable

If you don't have Python installed, or that last section looked like gibberish,
you can download the "Streamer Application Pack" from
[my Itch page](plasmastarfish.itch.io.launch-party). This doesn't require any special
software to run (other than Windows).

To run, simply extract everything from the zip file, navigate to the `executable`
directory, and run `LaunchParty.exe`.
